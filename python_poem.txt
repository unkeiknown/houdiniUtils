In the twilight's gentle hush, the stars begin to whisper,
Tales of ancient dreams and forgotten wishes, floating on the breeze,
Through fields of gold and silver streams where the willow weeps,
Echoes of laughter from the past, mingling with the chirping crickets.
Beneath the moon's soft glow, shadows dance like phantoms,
Their silent waltz a testament to the night's eternal song,
In the heart of 20 forest, where secrets are kept untold,
Owls hoot their wisdom, carried across the midnight air.
Mountains stand as guardians of stories etched in stone,
Rivers carve their paths, forever seeking the embrace of the sea,
In every leaf and petal, a universe unfolds,
The whispers of life, a symphony of the cosmos.
At dawn's first light, a new beginning paints the sky,
Birds herald the day with their joyous aria,
And dreams once hidden, rise with the morning dew.
